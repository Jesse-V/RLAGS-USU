INDI Library 3rd party drivers
==============================

You must install INDI Library before installing any 3rd party driver. By default, all 3rd party drivers are built and installed. 

# To get a list of all options, type:

$ cmake -L

# To build and install all the drivers:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
$ make
$ sudo make install

# To turn off a specific driver (for example INDI QHY)

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DWITH_QHY:OPTION=OFF .
