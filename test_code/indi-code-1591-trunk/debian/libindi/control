Description: Instrument-Neutral Device Interface library -- shared library
 INDI (Instrument-Neutral Device Interface) is a distributed XML-based
 control protocol designed to operate astronomical instrumentation.
 INDI is small, flexible, easy to parse, scalable, and stateless.
 It supports common DCS functions such as remote control, data acquisition,
 monitoring, and a lot more.
