CCD camera
----------
*  Option to apply selected rectangular region of interest in DS9 (if any 
   defined) automatically as ROI for CCD camera image, rather than having to
   fetch it via the 'Get imaging region' button.
*  Handling of colour images could be improved?  Examine min. and max. of each
   component (R, G and B) and force image display scaling in DS9 to be the same
   for each.

Guiding
-------
*  Hot pixel/column detection so that these features can be ignored when 
   selecting a guide star.
*  Implement dithering?
*  Save 'Subtract dark exposure' setting? (If autoguiding remotely, dark frame
   would need to be subtracted).
   
Focusing
--------
*  Hot pixel/column detection so that these features can be ignored for autofocus
   or focus calibration.
*  Add autofocus to task list?  In which case, it should automatically adjust
   the exposure length within given range to find faint stars or prevent bright
   ones from saturating with non-ABG chips.
*  Option to autofocus automatically after each filter change (rather than 
   applying pre-defined offsets)?
*  Option to autofocus before each exposure?

Telescope modelling
-------------------
*  Include an option to dump out all Gemini parameters to a file that can then
   be reloaded e.g. after battery change or cold start.
   
Video
-----
*  Option to convert recorded video to AVI/SER format.
*  Split frames into individual fields before performing photometry/astrometry.
	
Miscellaneous
-------------
*  PEC and Gemini configuration files to be more free format?
