CCD camera
----------
*  Option to apply selected rectangular region of interest in DS9 (if any 
   defined) automatically as ROI for CCD camera image, rather than having to
   fetch it via the 'Get imaging region' button.
*  Handling of colour images could be improved?  Examine min. and max. of each
   component (R, G and B) and force image display scaling in DS9 to be the same
   for each.

Guiding
-------
*  Hot pixel/column detection so that these features can be ignored when 
   selecting a guide star.
*  Add a guidestar search routine - telescope searches in small steps around 
   the central position?
*  Implement dithering?
*  Option to begin autoguiding again with guide star in same postion as 
   previous night (useful if CCD camera has been left attached)?
*  Save 'Subtract dark exposure' setting? (If autoguiding remotely, dark frame
   would need to be subtracted).
*  Characterise autoguider response in more detail - e.g. does a guide command
   of 1000 ms always give twice the shift of 500 ms?  How long does the 
   telescope take to start/stop moving?  Would need to take many samples to
   average out effects of periodic error.
   
Focusing
--------
*  Hot pixel/column detection so that these features can be ignored for autofocus
   or focus calibration.
*  Add autofocus to task list?  In which case, it should automatically adjust
   the exposure length within given range to find faint stars or prevent bright
   ones from saturating with non-ABG chips.
*  Option to autofocus automatically after each filter change (rather than 
   applying pre-defined offsets)?
*  Option to autofocus before each exposure?

Telescope modelling
-------------------
*  Offer choice of PEC curves to be automatically loaded depending on location 
   in sky?
*  Include an option to dump out all Gemini parameters to a file that can then
   be reloaded e.g. after battery change or cold start.
   
Video
-----
*  Option to convert recorded video to AVI format.
*  Split frames into individual fields before performing photometry/astrometry.
	
Miscellaneous
-------------
*  PEC and Gemini configuration files to be more free format?
